Microservices Architecture
Welcome to the E-Commerce Application built using Java, Spring Boot, JPA, MySQL, and Microservices. This project demonstrates a microservices-based architecture with separate services for user authentication, products, payments, notifications, and more. Each service is designed to handle a specific functionality, ensuring scalability and modularity.
